# TP 2: Les bases d'android

This project is based on https://github.com/StephanCaltot/formation-android-battleships; I have just completed the main functionalities and extended them:

* Added new rules: now ships cannot be placed one next to another.
* Added one new type of ship, the frigate, with length 1.
* Added new buttons to change player name and reset the game.
